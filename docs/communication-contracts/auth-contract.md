# Metis Auth Contract

This is the website-side copy of the shared auth bridge contract.

Use this file when changing auth entry points, callback routing, success-page behavior, or backend account validation for the extension bridge.

This is lane 2 inside the broader communication contract system.

## Architecture rule

- `Metis-Web` owns auth
- `Metis` owns local runtime
- the bridge is a one-time handoff, not full sync

The website must stay the identity surface. The extension must not become a second auth system.

## V1 goal

V1 keeps auth web-first and the extension local-first.

The extension stays usable without auth. A bridged website session unlocks connected account behavior and fuller insight access, but base scanning still works locally.

## Entry flow

When the extension needs website auth, it opens:

- production: `https://metis.zward.studio/sign-in?source=extension`
- development: `http://localhost:3000/sign-in?source=extension`

If sign-up is used instead, the same query rule applies:

- `/sign-up?source=extension`

## Callback flow

- website auth completes through `/auth/callback`
- extension-aware auth resolves into `/account/settings?source=extension`
- `/account/settings` is the bridge-capable dashboard route for extension-started auth
- `/auth/success` is compatibility-only and should redirect into `/account/settings?source=extension`

## Bridge method

The bridge uses `window.postMessage`.

Flow:

1. website loads `/auth/success`
2. website reads the authenticated session client-side
3. website posts `METIS_AUTH_SUCCESS`
4. content script validates origin, path, and payload
5. content script forwards the message to background
6. background stores the bridged auth locally
7. background validates account state with backend
8. background broadcasts connected auth state to extension surfaces
9. extension ACKs the success page so it can close

## Allowed origins and route

Only accept messages from this exact allowlist:

- `https://metis.zward.studio`
- `http://localhost:3000`

Rules:

- exact string match only
- no wildcard origins
- no preview domains
- no sibling subdomains
- localhost is development-only

Only accept auth bridge messages when the page location is:

- `/account/settings`

Ignore all other origins and paths.

## Query parameter rule

`source=extension` means:

- auth should preserve extension intent through the auth flow
- callback completion should land on `/auth/success`
- normal website auth behavior should stay unchanged when the parameter is absent

## Website message payload

```ts
type MetisAuthSuccessMessage = {
  type: "METIS_AUTH_SUCCESS";
  source: "metis-web";
  version: 1;
  session: {
    accessToken: string;
    expiresAt: number | null;
    user: {
      id: string;
      email: string | null;
    };
  };
};
```

## Extension ACK payload

```ts
type MetisAuthSuccessAck = {
  type: "METIS_AUTH_SUCCESS_ACK";
  source: "metis-extension";
  version: 1;
  ok: true;
};
```

## Storage rule

The extension stores bridged auth in `chrome.storage.local`.

V1 stores minimal data only:

- access token
- expiry when available
- user id
- user email when available
- validated account flags
- connection timestamp

V1 does not require refresh-token rotation.

Never store service-role secrets or backend-only credentials in the extension.

## Backend validation contract

After storing the basic bridged session, background validates it against backend.

Validation endpoint:

- `POST /v1/extension/validate`

Expected validated state:

- `plan`
- `plus_beta_enabled`
- `api_beta_enabled`
- `allow_plus_ui`
- `allow_report_email`

Backend validation is the source of truth for extension-side entitlement behavior.

## Extension storage shape

```ts
type StoredMetisWebSession = {
  accessToken: string;
  expiresAt: number | null;
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string | null;
  };
  account: {
    plan: "free" | "plus_beta" | "paid";
    plusBetaEnabled: boolean;
    apiBetaEnabled: boolean;
    allowPlusUi: boolean;
    allowReportEmail: boolean;
  };
  connectedAt: number;
};
```

## Entitlement rule

- all signed-in users get a connected extension session
- Plus and API unlocks still depend on server-side flags
- signed-in does not automatically mean Plus Beta
- signed-in does not automatically mean API Beta

## UI copy rule

Signed-out connected CTA:

- `Sign in to unlock full insights`

Signed-in connected state:

- `Connected to Metis ✓`

This bridge must not create a fake billing state or imply that website and extension data are fully synced.

## Success-page behavior

- success page posts bridge payload
- waits for extension ACK
- shows a short success state
- attempts `window.close()` after ACK
- shows manual fallback if no ACK arrives

The success page should not silently close without a verified handoff.

## Failure rule

Ignore and do not persist:

- unknown origins
- non-`/auth/success` pages
- malformed payloads
- missing tokens
- failed backend validation responses

If validation fails or the token later expires:

- clear connected state
- fall back to signed-out extension behavior

## Responsibility split

Website responsibilities:

- auth UI
- provider flows
- callback completion
- success-page bridge payload

Extension responsibilities:

- origin and route validation
- local auth storage
- connected UI state
- fallback to signed-out behavior

Backend responsibilities:

- token-backed account validation
- plan and beta-flag truth
- future protected bridge expansion

## Done in Metis-Web

- [x] `/sign-in?source=extension` and `/sign-up?source=extension` preserve extension intent
- [x] `/auth/callback` routes extension-aware auth into `/account/settings?source=extension`
- [x] `/account/settings?source=extension` posts `METIS_AUTH_SUCCESS`, waits for `METIS_AUTH_SUCCESS_ACK`, and shows fallback UI
- [x] bridge origin is locked to the exact allowlist: `https://metis.zward.studio` and `http://localhost:3000`
- [x] bridge route is private and kept out of indexing
- [x] extension-side listener, storage, ACK, and connected UI wiring are implemented in `Metis`
- [ ] production bridge still needs live end-to-end verification against the packaged extension
