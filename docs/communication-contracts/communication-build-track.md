# Metis Communication Build Track

This document defines the four communication lanes and the order Metis should build them.

The contract lock, website auth bridge, backend validation endpoint, and first upload routes now exist in `Metis-Web`. The extension-side bridge, storage, ACK flow, and access-state gating now exist in `Metis`. The remaining work is live verification and hardening, not first-pass adoption.

## Communication lanes

### 1. Extension UI ↔ Extension scanner

Used for:

- current page scan
- score updates
- issue list
- opening panel

This stays inside the extension.

### 2. Extension ↔ Website

Used for:

- sign-in start
- auth return
- upgrade prompts
- open dashboard and reports

This is the bridge layer.

### 3. Extension ↔ Backend API

Used for:

- analytics events
- summarized scan uploads
- premium requests
- account-linked features later

This is the data layer.

### 4. Website ↔ Backend

Used for:

- auth
- onboarding
- user account
- billing later
- saved reports later

This is normal app communication.

## Required build order

Build these in order. Do not skip ahead.

### Step 1: extension internal messaging first

Do first:

- content script gathers scan info
- popup and side panel request current scan state
- background coordinates current-tab actions
- UI renders the current result without backend dependence

Expected result:

- local scan communication works
- the panel can request and render a current score
- the extension feels useful without auth or backend

### Step 2: communication contract lock

Do after step 1:

- lock message names
- lock storage keys
- lock upload and access-state expectations
- keep all communication lanes in this folder instead of scattered notes

Expected result:

- later communication work uses one stable contract family
- auth, uploads, and access-state changes stop drifting

### Step 3: auth bridge

Do after step 2:

- extension opens website auth
- website returns authenticated state
- extension stores session locally

Expected result:

- extension can launch sign-in cleanly
- website can hand authenticated state back
- extension knows the user is connected without owning auth itself

### Step 4: backend validation and API communication

Do after step 3:

- add extension validation endpoint
- add analytics endpoint
- add summary upload endpoint
- add local queue and retry

Expected result:

- extension can validate account state against backend
- extension can send purposeful analytics events
- extension can send one summarized scan payload
- failed uploads do not disappear silently

### Step 5: gated features

Do after step 4:

- add free vs Plus state
- add premium request flow
- keep future saved reports behind the same contract model

Expected result:

- UI can derive gated behavior from validated access state
- premium actions stop depending on hardcoded UI guesses

## V1 milestone stack

### Milestone A

Work:

- local scan communication works

Expected result:

- Metis can scan locally and render results without the server

### Milestone B

Work:

- extension opens website auth

Expected result:

- user can move from extension to website auth cleanly

### Milestone C

Work:

- website returns authenticated state

Expected result:

- extension stores a connected session locally

### Milestone D

Work:

- extension uploads analytics and one summarized scan payload
- failed uploads queue locally

Expected result:

- backend communication is useful, event-based, and resilient

### Milestone E

Work:

- feature gating based on account state

Expected result:

- signed-out, free, and Plus behavior are derived from validated access state

## Locked communication principles

1. local first
2. web owns auth
3. backend receives summaries, not surveillance
4. communication is event-based, not constant streaming
5. every payload should answer: why does Metis need this?

## Current completion status

- [x] Step 1 extension internal messaging first
- [x] Step 2 communication contract lock
- [x] Step 3 auth bridge
- [x] Step 4 backend validation and API communication
- [x] Step 5 gated features

Current stage:

- `Step 5 / Milestone E`
- result: the shared communication stack is implemented and has moved into hardening and production verification
